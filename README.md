University System Database
This project is a database system designed for managing various aspects of a university, including students, courses, faculty, departments, and enrollment details. The database is implemented using SQL, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data.

Features
Students: Store and manage information about students, including student ID, name, address, and contact details.
Courses: Maintain a comprehensive list of courses offered by the university, including course ID, title, description, credit hours, and prerequisites.
Faculty: Keep track of faculty members teaching at the university, including faculty ID, name, specialization, and contact details.
Departments: Manage different departments within the university, including department ID, name, head of department, and location.
Enrollment: Track the enrollment of students in specific courses, including enrollment ID, student ID, course ID, and enrollment date.
Database Design
The database is designed using a relational model, comprising several tables with appropriate columns and relationships. The primary keys and foreign keys establish connections between the tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

The main tables in the database include:

Students: Stores student information and serves as a central entity for managing student-related data.
Courses: Contains information about the courses offered by the university and their properties.
Faculty: Stores details about the faculty members teaching at the university.
Departments: Represents the various departments within the university.
Enrollment: Tracks the enrollment of students in courses, linking students and courses together.
